Implement a new strong entity phone in the Sakila database. Attributes and relationships are shown in the following diagram:

The diagram uses Sakila naming conventions. Follow the Sakila conventions for your table and column names:

All lower case
Underscore separator between root and suffix
Foreign keys have the same name as referenced primary key
Write CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements that:

Implement the entity as a new phone table.
Implement the has relationships as foreign keys in the Sakila customer, staff, and store tables.
Remove the existing phone column from the Sakila address table.
Step 2 requires adding a foreign key constraint to an existing table. Ex:

ALTER TABLE customer 
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (phone_id) REFERENCES phone(phone_id)
  ON DELETE SET NULL
  ON UPDATE CASCADE;
Specify data types as follows:

phone_id, phone_number, and country_code have data type INT.
phone_type has date type VARCHAR(12) and contains strings like 'Home', 'Mobile', and 'Other'.
Apply these constraints:

NOT NULL constraints correspond to cardinalities on the diagram above.
Foreign key actions are SET NULL for delete rules and CASCADE for update rules.
Specify a suitable column as the phone table primary key.
